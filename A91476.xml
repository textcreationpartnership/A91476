            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I cannot better expreſs my Love and Reſpects to you, then by wiſhing and labouring for you that you may be Eternally ſaved; and no way can I find out otherwiſe to be effected,

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:170329:4"/>then that you be a reall ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved for ſome years paſt, that you make it much of your buſineſſe to keep up communion with God both in publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, which puts me in a great deal of hope you are in a fair way, both to receive further counſell, and to uſe all good means to bring about that in your ſoul and life which may fit you for that glory which is above in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>I offer therefore theſe (though but weak endeavours of mine, in compariſon of thoſe many worthier labors of thoſe Authors you have to converſe withall) to your ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and if theſe adde any thing to you, my mite will prove a mighty bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The ſubject is weighty, and if the arguments be ſo too, then they claim your ſubjection; for you muſt yield to Reaſon, and you muſt follow the Directions, or elſe you ſin againſt the Reaſon of a man, and the Rules of Religion, and the happineſſe of your
<pb facs="tcp:170329:4"/>own ſoul; If you read what I have written without prejudice and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication, and ponder without light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wavering; if you put in practiſe every duty commanded, and renounce every ſin, and forſake with invincible reſolution in good earneſt, and without procraſtination, thoſe ſins be they many or few, profitable or pleaſurable, open or ſecret, which you your own ſelf are tainted with, and follow Chriſt fully, and deny your ſelf wholly, and believe in the Lord Jeſus, and live Holily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo believing, and ſo living to your dying day: Then nothing in this preſent world can hinder your everlaſting happineſſe when you go hence; But if you or any man follow their own in-bred naughtineſſe, and walk after the fleſh, and put off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and live impenitent, and die unconverted; all the Angels in heaven, nor men on earth, nor trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of riches, nor all honours of this world, nor greatneſſe, policie, learning, nor any thing, nor all things, can procure your juſtification, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb facs="tcp:170329:5"/>or ſalvation at laſt. Nay if you live and die impenitent, and in a ſtate of unregeneracy and unconverted, Chriſt himſelf will never own you, nor will his precious blood be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for you; This I ſuppoſe you know already and believe, yet this I am bound to acquaint you withall as my full perſwaſion, and after this rate (you can teſtifie) I have always preached for all the ſpace I have been your monitor in this place: and oh that both you and I, and all that deſire to be ſaved eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally may reduce all the doctrinalls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this point of Reformation into our conſtant practiſe, and eſpouſe the thoughts of theſe things into our moſt retired and ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which will prove the rareſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the world, and give the fulleſt ſatisfaction to that ſoul which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I need not ſay much more to you, but to intreat you to peruſe at your leiſure theſe ſhort monitions, being <hi>An earnest Swaſion to a ſpeedy Reformation,</hi> and if they give any
<pb facs="tcp:170329:5"/>advantage or help toward your great work, <hi>that one thing neceſſary,</hi> give God the praiſe and thanks.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Madam,</hi> For an advantage to thoſe many good wiſhes I have for you, your nearneſſe of blood to one that is deareſt to me of any perſon in this world, makes me attempt this little tender of my Counſell to you alſo, hoping that by your ſerious peruſall you may either reſolve to attain to what is wanting to make your converſion compleat, or take occaſion hereby to bleſſe God that it is already begun in you, and in ſome good degree wrought, and ſo labour to goe on in a courſe toward greater perfection, in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that ever to be ſought after and mightily to be longed for happineſſe in heaven at your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hence, which is the enjoyment of Chriſt, and the compleatly full and filling joyes at Gods right hand in the kingdome of glory.</p>
            <p>And this is all the harm I wiſh you, and that this may be both your Lot, that you may be heirs together
<pb facs="tcp:170329:6"/>of the ſame grace which may put you (through Chriſt) into the full poſſeſſion of the ſame Glory, is the earneſt deſire to you and for you both, of him who is one that loves you upon the beſt account, And</p>

               <p>Thou haſt ſlighted Gods invitation,<note place="margin">S. 15.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted grace teaching, refuſed Chriſt reigning, reproched and ſcoffed at the Miniſters of Chriſt earneſtly perſwading: theſe things thou haſt done, and in all or ſome of theſe curſed courſes, thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, that it is grown to a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and as naturall to thee to ſin in one kind or other every day, as to breathe the aire, to move, eat, or drink, or ſleep, is it not?</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170329:12"/>
               <p>But if this make thee not yet know thy ſelf, then know farther,<note place="margin">S. 20.</note> and let this be to thee as it is in it ſelf, and eternal Truth, a decreed Law, That except thou (whoever thou art, either notoriouſly bad or ſeemingly tolerable to thy ſelf) be converted, reformed, ſo as to leave off in heart and life all thy known ſins, and lay apart all thy ungodlineſs, and lead an holy, ſober and righteous life, and that to the end, thou canſt not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Before Converſion comes,<note place="margin">S. 21.</note> before that gracious method of Regenerating ſouls paſs upon thee, and thou be reformed and brought out of the ſtate of ſinful nature into a ſtate of holy reformation, there is no hope for thee of thy ſalvation: Nature and ſin note thee a child of <hi>Adam;</hi> Grace and converſion declare thee a child of God, and an heir of a glorious Eternity.</p>
               <p>Well then,<note place="margin">S. 22.</note> thou art either unreformed in whole, or reformed but in part; to the one all is wanting, to the other ſomething is yet lacking to make thee a ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; each of you is the perſon to whom I addreſs my preſent ſwaſion.</p>
               <p>And I hope thou (ſo bad as thou haſt been hitherto) art not paſt all cure reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs;<note place="margin">S. 23.</note> and I am ſure thou art not, unleſs thou ſtill refuſe, and hardneſs hath taken

               <p>Poor ſoul,<note place="margin">S. 24.</note> thou haſt ſo much to begin withall towards thy ſaving change, thou haſt Reaſon, wilt thou let it but work, and wilt thou yeeld to reaſon?</p>
               <p>Thou haſt Faith,<note place="margin">S. 25.</note> ſome kind of faith; wilt thou believe what God by his Word hath revealed of his mind concerning thee and every man in thy caſe, and conſent to Truth?</p>
               <p>Thou haſt Conſideration;<note place="margin">S. 26.</note> wilt thou be ſerious, and conſider wiſely for thy ſelf thy own ſoul, how thou mayſt become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that thou mayſt become happy?

               <p>Thou haſt now an opportunity put into thy hand,<note place="margin">S. 27.</note> thou art once again called to, and perſwaded to be reformed; wilt thou follow this Call, and yeeld ere it be too

Now again it is offered thee, Chriſt is ready, and grace is ready, grace to aſſiſt thee, Chriſt to receive thee, the Word of God to guide thee, and holy Spirit to convert thee, and I thy hearty well-wiſher to thy excellent ſoul, do in the Name of Chriſt earneſtly entreat thee. —Now 'tis put to thy choice, whether thou embrace it or no, now is the acceptable time, the day of grace: To day therefore (O thou that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for thy ſoul) after ſo long a time, while it is to day; for if night come, if death come before thy work of converſion be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, thou muſt lie down in ſorrow, and poſſeſs an eternity of horrid darkneſs and woful miſery.</p>
               <p>Come Man,<note place="margin">S. 28.</note> I think thou haſt ſo much Reaſon, ſo much Faith, ſo much Conſideration, ſo much Experience, as to underſtand and believe that thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs lieth not here below in this terreſtrial world, but in Heaven with God above in glory; and that thou wert made for ſome higher end than to live among viſible creatures, to eat, drink, work, play and ſleep; ſure thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there are other things to be looked after by one of an immortal principle, than to gather terrene riches, and to taſte bodily and ſenſual delights and honors in this preſent life.</p>
               <p>Know excellent Creature, know,<note place="margin">S. 29.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170329:14"/>thy Creator and mine hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us for more excellent work, and moſt tranſcendent happineſs.</p>
               <p>And this I am perſwading thee to ſeek after,<note place="margin">S. 30.</note> and provide for, I have no deſign with thee or upon thee in this buſineſs that is low or baſe, but high and noble. I come not thus to thee from any earthly Prince, to beg or command thy worldly goods, but from the King of glory, to intreat and command, and beſeech thee to part with thy ſhame and miſery, thy ſins, and turn to Chriſt and holineſs, and to beſeech thee that thou wouldeſt yeeld to be made gloriouſly happy; all the harm I mean thee is that thou mayeſt be ſaved, and this is the beſt, the very beſt thing I can wiſh to thee and my ſelf alſo, and all that I would have thee part with is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that is ſin: Which all Gods children are glad at the heart they are rid of, and that they are gotten out of the dominions and regions of ſin, into the Kingdom of Chriſt and under his rule.</p>
               <p>Then that we may reaſon together to ſome good purpoſe,<note place="margin">S. 31.</note> be but plain-hearted and honeſt in this buſineſs, lay aſide all prejudice, make no ſhifts, no evaſions, fear nothing Man if thou meaneſt to be good and holy in good earneſt, there are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170329:14"/>no invincible Giants in the Kingdom of Chriſtianity; put on the reſolution of a man and thou wilt be victorious, mean but as well to thy ſoul as I do, and then to be ſure thou wilt be as earneſt with God for to reform thee, and as carefull to uſe the means and take the opportunity, as I am to perſwade thee to it.</p>
               <p>Be but as willing to ſubmit to the teaching of grace,<note place="margin">S. 32.</note> and to accept of the proffered help from Chriſt, and then ſhalt thou quickly be rid of thy damning ſins, and be brought into a holy and ſaving frame of ſpirit and courſe of life.</p>
               <p>I obſerve (and ſo may you,<note place="margin">S. 33.</note>) that when Chriſt had a mind to do good, and ſhew a ſpeciall favour to any in diſtreſſe, (And our dear Lord Chriſt hath ſtill the ſame mind toward every poor ſinner to this day to do him good,) his firſt queſtion to ſuch is, <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> And,<note place="margin">John 5.6. Mar. 10.51</note> 
                  <hi>what wilt thou that I ſhould do unto thee?</hi> And no ſooner the poor ſinner can find in his heart to be willing to be helped and healed, and to ſeek unto Chriſt in good earneſt, but immediately Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will, be thou whole, Take up and walk,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 8 3.</note> 
                  <hi>I will, be thou clean;</hi> and the Text ſaith, <hi>And immediately his Leproſie was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And likwiſe take notice,<note place="margin">S. 34.</note> that the cauſe why a miſerable ſinner continues unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170329:15"/>and under the power of his ſins, is becauſe he will not, hath no mind to be altered, doth not earneſtly deſire it. That this is ſo, you may ſee <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 13.27. <hi>I have ſeen thy abomination,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 13.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe unto thee, wilt thou not be made clean, when will it once be?</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31, 32. <hi>I have no pleaſure</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in the death</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.31, 32.</note> damnation) <hi>of a ſinner, but rather he ſhould turn and live;</hi> and that the cauſe of mens ruine and deſtruction is from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather then they will turn they will die. <hi>Why will ye die? turn you from all your tranſgreſſions, why will ye die?</hi> So likewiſe our Saviour Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 5.40. tels us why men loſe their Souls and happineſs,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.40.</note> it is, <hi>They will not come unto me that they might have Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I obſerve alſo when a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the neceſſity of Salvation,<note place="margin">S. 35.</note> and by the conſideration of the greatneſs of his ſins, and neceſſity of leaving them all, yet the difficulty of converſion and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with old friends, (as a ſinner thinks his luſts and ſins are) he cryes out, <hi>what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16.30.</note> as the Jaylor did <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. Which is the firſt quere to be made: and when a ſinner comes to this once, to be willing and ſeriouſly deſirous from his very Soul to be made whole and clean, and then earneſtly to ſeek out how he may act that he may be ſaved, then Chriſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170329:15"/>takes him to cure, and then directs him by his word, and helps him by his Spirit, firſt to Reformation here, and then to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now precious ſoul,<note place="margin">S. 36.</note> is it in thy heart to deſire, and doſt ſeriouſly ask what thou ſhalt do to be ſaved? (If ſo,) I have it from God to tell thee that thou mayeſt be ſaved, If thou believe in the Lord Jeſus, repent thee, and turn thee from all thy ungodlineſs, to ſerve the living God in Righteouſneſs and true holineſs, from this day to the end of thy life, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Reformation in heart and life, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou ſubmit to Reformation,<note place="margin">S. 37.</note> wouldeſt thou be made clean, and be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually turned from all thy ſinfull thoughts and practiſes? O poor ſinner art willing?</p>
               <p>Then firſt try thy heart,<note place="margin">S. 38.</note> whether in good earneſt thou deſire it; canſt thou go in ſecret, and pour out thy ſoul, and utter thy deſires before the Lord, in this or the like prayer, for this very thing that thou mayſt be reformed? If thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then to be reformed from thy very ſoul, thou canſt ſpeak thy Requeſts to God, to help thee through the work, and then thou wilt be willing to take up ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſideration, and yeeld to the intreaties, and fall upon the practiſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170329:16"/>without more ado, ſpeedily without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, if thou canſt thus pray from thy heart, there is great hope of thy Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

I am one of thoſe vile and miſerable ſinners whom thou haſt often called to amendment, to whom thou haſt ſent thy ſervants, importunately beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I would ceaſe to do evill, and learn to do well, that I would but turn and live; but hitherto I have not fully yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I have (dear Lord) too too often and too too long put thee off with excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and when I could ſay nothing for my continuance in ſinne, nor againſt holy living, and speedy reformation, yet then have I delayed my neceſſary duty with a promiſe of reformation, delaying from day to day that which I have promiſed, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally going on in that which I ſhould renounce, even to this day, O Lord, thou knoweſt it.</p>
               <p>Many opportunities have been given unto me, much grace offered,<note place="margin">S. 3.</note> many Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, many Sermons, many Counſels, many a check of Conſcience, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes from the Lord in ſad diſpenſations,

I have abuſed thy long-ſufferance, made light of thy invitations, and all thy ſweet and kind perſwaſions and fatherly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. I have heard thy Meſſengers ſpeaking to me time after time from the Lord, ſaying often with tears in their eyes to me, Regardleſſe, hard-hearted Wretch, Oh do not, do not the abominable things which I hate, O why wilt thou die? But all in vain; my obſtinate hard heart hath ſaid, There is no hope, I will not change nor amend.</p>

               <p>I have heard from thy Word,<note place="margin">S. 5. Mat. 18.3.

Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean, holy, just, ſober, and a ſound convert; thou haſt bid me (although a miſerable ſinner) to ask according to thy will, and thou haſt promiſed to hear and grant.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Reformation in the notion of it, as it is intended for practiſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>REformation (which is the ſubject I am about to treat of,<note place="margin">S. 1.</note>) is a word not very frequently uſed in Scripture, but the thing I mean by it is in many places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And I chuſe this term of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> becauſe it comprehends what I mean to exhort you to, and as it is a Vulgar word beſt known to ſuch as I am writing to; and you underſtand thus much by it, that when a man hath been vicious, vain, worldly, naught, and hath left off thoſe wretched courſes, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſober, juſt, ſerious, humble, charitable and good, now (ſay they) he is a <hi>reformed</hi> man or a <hi>changed</hi> man, another manner of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170329:19"/>man then he was before, he is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, a man of an other nature and life; I mean by it much the ſame thing as you underſtand it; but in this latitude I mean no leſs by Reformation then a through Change of diſpoſition and life from that which is bad, diſpleaſing to God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to thy own precious ſoul, to that which is good, and commanded by God, and of neceſſity to be done by thee in order to thy ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And if you underſtand better the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your <hi>duty</hi> by theſe <hi>expreſſions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Converſion, Repentance, Regeneration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, Sanctification, Returning,</hi> then whatever is comprehended under any or all theſe terms I mean by Reformation, and ſo much I aim at by this perſwaſion to a ſpeedy Reformation.</p>
               <p>For the word in its own proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a ſtate unto which either perſons or things diſordered and out of courſe are reduced,<note place="margin">S. 3.</note> as unto their <hi>firſt form</hi> or <hi>ſtate</hi> wherein they ſhould be, either by <hi>creation,</hi> or <hi>appointment</hi> and <hi>Inſtitution:</hi> now every ſin, and Inclination to it is a great diſorder, and holineſs is the Rectitude and right frame of ſoul. Therefore untill I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed I am out of order, and out of the way to eternall happineſs, and in a courſe leading to eternall miſery; ſo that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is a <hi>Reducement</hi> of the heart and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170329:20"/>life of man, every man that means to be ſaved, to that ſtate and frame of ſoul and life as is meet for heaven, ſuch as unto which God hath promiſed eternal life.</p>
               <p>And when I perſwade you to think on your ſins,<note place="margin">S. 4.</note> and be ſad at the heart, grieve and lament that you have been ſo bad by inclination an evil practices, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to leave off all your tranſgreſſions, and turn to God and holy living, then I mean <hi>true repentance</hi> by reformation; when I intreat you to change your evil diſpoſition of heart, of your mind and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered affections, and evil actings of your life, to live unto God, to adhere unto him, to ſerve him in all things, to lead a pure and holy life, then I mean <hi>ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> joyned with <hi>ſanctification</hi> by refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>And you muſt grant,<note place="margin">S. 5.</note> That ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſound converſion is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation; and every one that is come to years muſt repent and be converted, or elſe he cannot, for he ſhall not, be ſaved.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of mans ſtate before Reformation, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of amendment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving declared what I intend by Reformation,<note place="margin">S. 1.</note> I ſhall ſhew you that ſuch a reformation God requires of thee, and every one that means to be ſaved, as abſolutely neceſſary to thy ſalvation: 'Tis not a thing indifferent, as though it may or may not go well with thy ſoul, whether thou perform it or no; but, in plain terms, be reformed and thou ſhalt ſurely be <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> be not reformed and thou ſhalt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be <hi>damned;</hi> and until reformation come on thee, thou art no better than a <hi>child of wrath,</hi> a <hi>ſervant of ſin,</hi> and ſo in a ſtate of <hi>enmity againſt God,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under the power of Satan, and a ſubject of his horrid Regiment, and a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel fitted to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtate of mankind (you believe) was a ſtate of <hi>perfection;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. 2.</note> God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, holy and good, without ſin, or any actuall diſorder or deformity; and if man had ſtood to this, and continued in his <hi>Primitive Integrity,</hi> there had not needed but adheſion to God to have ſecured the eternall happineſs on man, there wanted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170329:21"/>not <hi>Reformation,</hi> for there yet was no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the unhappy defection that our firſt Parents made,<note place="margin">S. 3.</note> brought themſelves and mankind (unto this day) into a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate of ſin and miſery; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with ſin, diſhonored, diſordered and ſpoiled, we are no more to be accounted of but as enemies to God, a company of loſt and miſerable wretches, carrying in our very nature the markes of ſhame and miſery; and untill <hi>reſtoring grace</hi> comes, we are but (O ſad to ſay!) the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, being firſt enemies to God, God is become a God lothing (but juſtly lothing) us in this ſtate (as 'tis ſaid)<note n="*" place="margin">Zach. 11.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Their ſoul abhorred me,</hi> and <hi>my ſoul loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 3.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for there is none righteous</hi> (before reſtoring grace come) <hi>no not one;</hi> for all are under ſin, the power, guilt, and filth of ſin,<note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>And by nature the children of wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as long as any man is in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall eſtate,<note place="margin">S. 4.</note> acting according to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of his ſoul, following the ſinfull <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>luſtings</hi> of his own depraved heart, he is ſtill under the <hi>power of ſin,</hi> and <hi>curſe of the Law,</hi> and hath nothing to do with God as a Father, nor with heaven as an inheritance; ſin cuts him off from thoſe relations, and continuance in ſin debates him quite from any benefit of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, onely there is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170329:21"/>afforded poſſibillty to be ſaved, through the Commiſeration of God toward miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, and to repair in man what was defaced, and to reſtore by Chriſt what was loſt by <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if thou return in time while grace is offered thee,<note place="margin">S. 5.</note> and Chriſt is calling thee, if thou leave off thy ſins, and become a new man, if thou ſubmit to reformation, and doſt repent thee of and forſake all thy ſins, and leadeſt a new life, <hi>walking in the commandements of God</hi> conſtantly and ſincerely, if thou art throughly converted in heart and life, thou mayſt be ſaved; but otherwiſe, if thou continueſt unregenerate, and abideſt impenitent, and art not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and wilt not be reformed, never hope to be ſaved, but in terror and trembling of ſoul expect to enter into that horrid and black eternity of miſery, unavoidable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable, when thou art taken by death (in thy ſins) out of this World.</p>
               <p>If you are not yet perſwaded of this,<note place="margin">S. 6.</note> conſult theſe following Texts impartially, which render what I ſay (and therefore I affirm it conſtantly) undeniable, being the decreed Law of God about this very thing, and undoubtedly ſhall be made good.</p>
               <p>This truth is that we muſt acquaint you withall,<note place="margin">S. 7.</note> and this is that I mind you now of from the Lord,<note n="*" place="margin">Eſai. 3.10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Say unto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170329:22"/>it ſhall goe well with them, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked, it ſhall go ill with him, for the reward of his hand ſhall be given him.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his Iniquities.</hi> Now this is ſaid to thee, who ere thou art, in thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe, or in any one way which is ſinfull, and if thou doe not turn from that thy wickedneſs, thou art a dead man, a loſt man; this will not be repealed, thou muſt turn or die, ſlight it not, it is thy particular caveat as much as any is in the world.</p>
               <p>There is another ſuch like place,<note place="margin">S. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. v. 20. to the end of the Chapter. The ſumme is this,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.20.</note> that though God <hi>takes no pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die,</hi> but that <hi>he ſhould turn and live,</hi> yet the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon himſelf, and he that commits Iniquity, and dyeth in them, <hi>for the iniquity that he hath done ſhall he die; but if the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and keep all my ſtatutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall ſurely live.</hi> Then the counſell is this, v. 30. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelve; from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your ruine, wherefore turn and live.</hi> Can there be any more juſt and plain dealing then this? Which is fitternow, that thou ſhouldſt turn
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170329:22"/>from thy wicked ways, or that God ſhould abrogate this Law of his after all this warning given thee? Conſider this, ſinner, and turn, or expect to burn for ever.</p>
               <p>The next proof I bring out of the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">S. 9.</note> which ſhall not leave the leaſt refuge of hope to any unreformed man, that he may be ſaved and not converted. I deſire you be ſerious and conſider them well, and doe not turn them ſlightly over, with an <hi>I hope I may be ſaved for all this:</hi> for certainly as thou art alive thou muſt be reformed or thou canſt not be ſaved. Wilt thou believe what Chriſt hath ſaid? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.3.</note> 
                  <hi>that except ye be converted, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdome of Heaven:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 3.3.</note> and John 3.3. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God.</hi> What think you of this? doe you believe this in good earneſt? can you evade it? If you think that God of his grace may ſave you without ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, then ſee what Gods ſaving grace teaches all that may hope to be ſaved,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation hath appeared, teaching, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> And when this is done in ſincerity, then the 13. verſe bids us, <hi>Look for that bleſſed hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> But untill this Reformation be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170329:23"/>wrought, a turning from evil, all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and living holy, there is no hope of ſalvation.</p>

If thou art, or haſt been a ſouldier in thine own Nation, and haſt been in ſuch robberies, repent for it, and if thou art able, make reſtitution of things ſo gotten. If thou art, or haſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170329:44"/>been a ſon or a ſervant,<note place="margin">Pro. 28.24</note> and haſt filcht from or cheated thy Parents or Maſter of any thing, either in thy cuſtody commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy charge, or taken it to thy ſelf, or conveyed it to others; then repent and do ſo no more; make ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the parties wronged, either with confeſſion of thy fault with a deſire of pardon, or reſtitution ſome way or other; aske God forgiveneſs and promiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and do no more ſo wickedly.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170329:57"/>ſimilation or feigning ones ſelf to be holy, juſt, good, devout and godly, when he is nothing ſo; a repreſentation of what a man ſhould be,<note place="margin">Eſa. 32.6.</note> but (God knowes) he is not in reality ſuch an one as he would ſeem to be; Hypocriſie is a religious lie, a counterfeit golineſſe: our Saviour Chriſt ſets forth an Hypocrite (for he knows them well enough) under the likeneſſe of a painted, whited ſepulchre; <hi>ye are like</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to whited ſepulchres,</hi>

                  <p>Now to pray much,<note place="margin">S. 98.</note> to pray often, to profeſſe Religion openly, to diſcourſe of godlineſſe, to talk of Heaven, to ſpeak againſt ſin, to hear the word of God, to receive the Sacrament, to profeſſe ſelf-denial, to ſet apart times for, &amp; to joyn in, publick or private humiliation, to make ſcruple of omiſſions of good duties, and to be ſtrict in ſmaller matters, or the like, are not acts of Hypocriſie; for theſe things ſhould every religious man perform; but yet he that doth all theſe may be an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite while he doth them, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> if he reſt in the outward performance, if his heart

Jo. 1.47.</note> when there is truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the heart, without guile: Now one would think that no man living that profeſſeth faith in Chriſt, or that believes truly that God is the diſcerner of the hearts, thoughts, intentions, deſigns, and all the actions, (with all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,) ſhould be ſo myſteriouſly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, prophane &amp; Atheiſtical; this is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indeed, and ſuch as the charity of the ſincere and upright Chriſtian doth

Examine therefore thy ſelf, and obſerve well thy own heart and life, whether thou be Hypocritical; I ſay not (to thee,) thou ſhouldeſt judg and cenſure another for an Hypocrite, but look unto thy ſelf, and ſee whether thy ſelf be a religious diſſembler or no.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>An Enumeration of more ſins and wayes by which man offends God, and contracts guilt to his ſoul, of which he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have in the foregoing Sections given you a particular of ſome of the moſt groſs and notorious fins,<note place="margin">S. 1.</note> their names, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condemnation; all or any one of them, if thou art guilty, and meaneſt to live in, will bring damnation to thy body and ſoul moſt certainly.</p>
               <p>And there are many more ſins then thoſe mentioned which lay claim to Hell for their reward,<note place="margin">S. 2.</note> which the holy book of God and the ſpirituall guides of thy ſoul (if thou conſult them,) would ſufficiently inſtruct thee about how thou mayſt either avoid and prevent them, or repent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them all, though lying within thy <hi>heart, thoughts, words</hi> or <hi>actions;</hi> for Gods Spirit would conduct thee alſo.</p>
               <p>And further,<note place="margin">S. 3.</note> things ſometimes tolerably <hi>lawfull</hi> to be done, may through <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> become <hi>unlawfull,</hi> and a ſin to thee if thou doſt them; and there are ſome things ſome perſons may doe at ſome times, &amp; in ſome caſes, which another may not doe without a ſin, nor
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170329:75"/>the ſame perſon at another time, or under another relation, but it will be a fault. It were eaſie to inſtance in examples of this kind, but they would be a ſubject fit for determination of caſes of Conſcience, which now I am not about; yet this I would adviſe thee (if thou meaneſt to walk <hi>circumſpectly,</hi> and exerciſe a good <hi>conſcience</hi> always,) that in things <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>disputable</hi> take the ſureſt part, that part of the queſtion which is ſurely no ſin: for inſtance, is dicing or carding lawfull? or to wear black ſpots, as the manner of ſome is? or to put money to uſury? With ſome this may be a queſtion, but for my part I would thus reſolve it; that it may be unlawfull and a ſin to play at cards or dice, or to put on thoſe ſtrange faſhions, or to practiſe uſury, &amp;c. but not to play at either, or with either, at any time at all, nor to lend upon uſury, nor to conform to the fantaſtical faſhions of dreſſing, is doubtleſs no ſin; and a wiſe ſoul would take the ſafeſt courſe, and walk in the ſureſt way, and avoid all appearance of ſin as well as all ſins; and he that doth not doe that, that is, ſhun as much as poſſible all appearance of evil, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Goſpel-rule,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And indeed many foul and il-favoured ſins,<note place="margin">S. 5.</note> to which men give full conſent and delight, are choked with the name, and maintained in heart and practice with an opinion that they will be accounted of as leſſer irregularities, deviations, humane frailties and infirmities; for men are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to think they may live in ſins of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſafely and laudably, and therefore are willing to believe that all their omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of good duties, and commiſſions of evil works, are but as ſo many infirmities, and eaſily pardoned, without either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking them, or ſtriving againſt them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of them.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170329:82"/>for which he hath received his life, time and talent.</p>
                  <p>And it may be thou art ſuch an one,<note place="margin">S. 22.</note> of whom if one ſhould ask, what good haſt thou done ſince firſt thou receivedſt breath? that though thou haſt received much good, yet haſt thou brought forth little, —alas, men doe not conſider the ſin of idleneſs, nor the danger of it; 'tis a dangerous thing to be without a lawfull calling, and as bad to be idle in it; to have nothing to doe, or to doe nothing in a lawfull imployment, doubtleſs is that which is neither <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God, nor <hi>innocent</hi> in it ſelf: God made nothing in <hi>vain,</hi> 'tis a ſin confeſſed to <hi>doe evil,</hi> and ſo it is not to doe <hi>ſome good or other.</hi> The ſervant that had a talent, and hid it, is condemned by our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Cast ye the unprofit able ſervant into outer darkneſs,</hi>

                  <p>Yet this is not thought on any whit by thoſe that are idle and vain perſons,<note place="margin">S. 23.</note> who ſpend their life and precious time either in doing nothing at all, or that which is beſide the buſineſs of a Chriſtian man, as doing that which is evil: the devil commonly ſets ſuch on work whom he finds idle; &amp; what an empty vain thing it is for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to have nothing to employ themſelves in but to receive and pay unneceſſary viſits<note place="margin">Acts 17.21.</note>

I have heard of ſome that they never dreamed, or very rarely; how true it is I cannot affirm, but I wiſh I could have ſaid ſo truly, or that any dreames had alwayes been (but as ſometimes they have) good and edifying: I have been diſciplined by dreames, ſome of them have been the occaſion of comfort, ſome of ſorrow and much affliction to my ſoul, ſince I knew from whence they ſprang; bad, from an ill principle, vain, ambitious, worldly, filthy, fleſhly mindings and thinkings in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; the good from God: and look what a mans intentions, and diſcourſings, and companyings, and thinkings have moſtly been when awake, commonly the man
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170329:85"/>dreames about when a ſleep, though in much confuſion; and as the nature of thoſe things acted or minded, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and end are about them, either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and holy, or ſinfull and wicked, ſo are thy dreames to be accounted of either good or bad; and as you would repent for an ill act waking, ſo muſt you repent and be humbled for your dreames of the acts thereof, if with delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the ſame; &amp; as you would be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be found doing or minding with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thoſe vanities or wickedneſſes you <hi>dreame</hi> about, ſo muſt you be humbled in your ſelves for <hi>dreaming</hi> ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>And if ever thou come to be truly and ſoundly converted,<note place="margin">S. 32.</note> you will find your dreames either to be ſanctified, or elſe both them and your vain thoughts to be your great burthen; and you will ſtill be begging of God to heal the diſtempers of your great burthen; and you will ſtill be begging of God to heal the diſtempers of your ſouls this way, and free you from ſinfull dreames; and in the mean time to remember alway upon your examination, that the guilt of your vain thoughts on the day, and vain dreames in the night might be pardoned, and the filth of them waſhed off your ſoul with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And this I adviſe thee and exhort thee to, that if after all thy care, prayer, &amp; watchfulneſs over thy thoughts, diſcourſes, actions and company, (leſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170329:86"/>thou offend,) yet (I ſay) if that after all thy circumſpection thou be haunted and acted with vain, filthy, worldly, and any impure viſions in thy dreames, that then in the morning, every morning in thy addreſſes to God in private devotions, after ſuch defilements, thou <hi>humble thy</hi> ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and <hi>repent thee</hi> heartily, and bewail that infirmitie, and beg thy pardon for what is paſt, and intreat the Lord for Chriſt ſake to heal thy naughty nature, and that God would by his grace prevent the evil ſpirit ſuggeſting, and thy fancies acting, or awaken thee aſſoon as ere it ſeiſeth upon thee.</p>
                  <p>For that man that truly fears God,<note place="margin">S. 33.</note> and hates ſin, would not if he could have any fellowſhip or delight in vanity, either waking or ſlumbring, by day or by night, with others or alone; for God is about thy path, and about thy bed, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy up-riſing, and down-lying, every thought, and every word, &amp; every action, yea and every dreame too; and thy God is holy, and hates all impiety, every where and in every perſon; therefore be mindfull of them, and be watchfull over thy inward &amp; outward ſelf, every hour, in every place and action, as thou ever hopeſt to avoid ſin, to keep thy ſelf pure, and to pleaſe God; for <hi>Jude</hi> the 8th. verſe ſpeaks of <hi>Filthy dreamers who defile the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The want of the conſideration of the heinouſneſs of ſin,<note place="margin">S. 21. Plaſ. 51.</note> was the occaſion that let that good man <hi>David</hi> looſe to a ſin which afterward coſt him many a ſalt tear; and it was well for him he found <hi>place for

                  <hi>How can I doe this great wickedneſs and ſin against-God?</hi> and this conſideration kept him from that act of folly, which otherwiſe he might have committed to his wounding and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering.</p>

               <p>Now how would you brook ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this?<note place="margin">S. 76.</note> is this good counſell? would this be acceptable to you? would you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch an one your friend indeed that ſhould thus perſwade thee? or wouldeſt thou not take ſuch language as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Sarcaſme,</hi> moſt bitter <hi>taunt, ſcorn</hi> and <hi>jeer</hi> that any man in the world could put upon or inſult over thee withall? wouldſt thou not account him either a ſtarke <hi>fool,</hi>

               <p>Yet alas even ſo it is that my own heart deals thus with me all the while I go on in my ſin,<note place="margin">S. 77.</note> and delay my reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; every ſuggeſtion from my ſelf, to which I yeild to put off my repentance and amendment, is juſt ſuch a counſell, and the counſell of a naughty mans heart that hindersſpeedy reſolution to become a <hi>new creature,</hi> are the very ſame when arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated as you have here read.</p>
               <p>O then why ſhould I ever <hi>yeild</hi> to that in my ſelf,<note place="margin">S. 78.</note> and do that by my own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell which I ſhould diſlike from another? why ſhould I delay my reformation upon that account which I ſhould be aſhamed to offer to another, and abhorre any other ſhould propoſe to me? and yet for all this I do the ſame thing all the while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my ſin, or <hi>wave,</hi> or <hi>delay</hi> my turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all and every one of my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions to ſerve the Lord Chriſt; have I all this while cheated and befooled my ſelf, and ſhall I continue to do ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtill?

                  <p>This favourable conceit of ſin (I believe) hath betrayed many an unwiſe ſoul to their <hi>undoing,</hi>

                     <hi>leſſen</hi> their faults, and to reduce them to a narrow compaſſe and minute inſtance; how eaſy it is with men to do wonders in this kind when they have a mind to it, but how difficult are far more eaſy matter when they are actions to be done? with what <hi>facility</hi> doth a wicked man make his great ſins <hi>little,</hi> his many ſins <hi>few,</hi> and his little ſins and few none at all, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? but God will not be ſo indulgent to thy ſins, although thou art.</p>
                  <p>Now can you not eaſily repel this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">S. 3.</note> and refute this ſmooth opinion, that it prevail not with thee ſo as to cauſe thee lay aſide thy repentance for the preſent? <hi>Thus;</hi> my ſins they are not <hi>great,</hi> but are they not <hi>many,</hi> are they <hi>many,</hi> and are they not <hi>great?</hi> nor many, nor great? But are they any at all? though they are not many, nor great, yet they are <hi>more</hi> then I can reckon, and <hi>greater</hi> then I can bear; if I am guilty but of one kind of ſin, yet that is too much by one; if I have acted that ſin but once, yet that is by once too often; if I have lived but one day without repentance, 'tis a day too long; I ſhould not have ſinned at all, there was no <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> for it, I had no command from God to ſin, neither did any decree of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me to commit a ſin; but ſince I have been ſo unhappy to fall, though but once, there is now a neceſſity I riſe again by

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet it is too evident,<note place="margin">S. 4.</note> that though a ſin be but one for title, 'tis <hi>multiplied</hi> in the act, and he that commits one ſin commits <hi>more</hi> then <hi>one fault,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 2.10.</note> he breaks all the whole Law of God; and he that tranſgreſſeth the <hi>whole Law</hi> of God is not without much guilt, nor many ſins; and ſhall I deferre my repentance upon the account of <hi>little</hi> or <hi>few</hi> ſins, if it were true that my ſins were ſmal, and of them but a few? nay ſhould not this be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to haſten my repentance, and to ceaſe from my ſins, becauſe but few and ſmall, for that they are more <hi>eaſily</hi> forſaken, and more <hi>readily</hi> pardoned upon my true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and by leaving them ſpeedily I ſhall prevent the growth, both for number and bigneſs, and accompliſh with far leſs difficulty that deſired and neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
                  <p>But yet I muſt not leave this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo,<note place="margin">S. 5.</note> there is more in it then may ſafely be over-looked, for the conceit of little and few, when applyed to ſins, is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; how can a man be humbled for his ſins, or be heartily forry for them, when he thinks they are neither <hi>heinous</hi> nor

                     <hi>hurtfull,</hi> that they will not at all <hi>hinder</hi> his <hi>ſalvation,</hi> nor very much offend God, ſeeing his ſins are not many or great, but the common frailties and infirmities of humanity; Oh, how many hath this fond favorable opinion <hi>lullabied</hi> in faſt <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and made them proof againſt all reproof and counſell, to the ruin of their ſouls!</p>
                  <p>And is it not an argument I would ſell God's favour,<note place="margin">S. 6.</note> and procure his diſpleaſure at a cheap rate, when I will not <hi>refrain</hi> to do evil, and forſake my evil doings, which as you ſay are but few, or ſmall? 'tis little a man would do either for God's ſake, or his own ſoul, if he will not forſake a few and ſmall ſins, a trifle and a folly.</p>
                  <p>But now to put off all delays that might be entertained upon this account of ſmall and few ſins,<note place="margin">S. 7.</note> let me conſider, that in truth every ſin, be it never ſo little in mans eſteem, is againſt an INFINITE GOD; 'tis a <hi>violation</hi> of his Law by a direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his Soveraignty, 'tis a <hi>wound</hi> &amp; a <hi>poyſon,</hi> a <hi>ſpot</hi> and <hi>defilement</hi> to any mans ſoul that doth the leaſt of ſin, that keeps and loves it, that would excuſe it and make eaſie of his ſin, as though it were innocent and harmleſs; and though the <hi>instance</hi> be but <hi>ſmall</hi> by which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, yet my <hi>offence is great,</hi> becauſe for ſo ſmall a matter I offend ſo great a God.</p>
